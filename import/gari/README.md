# GARI import script.

This directory contains a script that is used to pull data from [GARI](http://www.mobileaccessibility.info/).  They store both device and app data.


# The data and conversion process

## GARI's data format

GARI provides [an RSS feed](http://www.mobileaccessibility.info/download-gari-db.cfm) that represents their current device data.

### Overall Structure

The main structure of their feed is roughly:

```
 <rss>
   <channel>
     <description>...</description>
     <FeatureCategories>
       <FeatureSet>
         <Category>HARDWARE INFORMATION</Category>
         <FeatureSpec>
           <FeatureTitle>Handset weight</FeatureTitle>
           <SpecType>OneNumValUnit</SpecType>
           <Unit>Grams</Unit>
         </FeatureSpec>
         <FeatureSpec>...</FeatureSpec>
       </FeatureSet>
       <FeatureSet>...</FeatureSet>
     </FeatureCategories>

     <product> ... See Below ... </product>
     <product> ... See Below ... </product>
   </channel>
 </rss>
```

The `FeatureCategories` data will largely be ignored for now, but it does represent a dictionary of the features GARI tracks.  This information corresponds to the `<item>` elements in a given [product](#product-record-structure).

It may be useful in providing updates to GARI or comparing the GARI ontology to that used by EASTIN.

## Product record structure

In the RSS feed, individual product records look like:

```
<product>
    <objectid>1808</objectid>
    <productpic>http:gari.info/goget.cfm?picfile=17131D0D1101134C1B0D555A57595F1F554C0D1115</productpic>
    <Manufacturer-Importer>Samsung</Manufacturer-Importer>
    <ProductBrand>Samsung</ProductBrand>
    <Model>SGH-I317 (Galaxy Note2)</Model>
    <Platform>Android</Platform>
    <PlatformVersion>KiKat 4.4</PlatformVersion>
    <Countries>United States</Countries>
    <Regions>North America</Regions>
    <Website>http:www.samsung.com/us</Website>
    <DateCompleted>Oct-30-2014</DateCompleted>
    <item>
    <Feature>Handset weight</Feature>
    <Description>Weight including battery.</Description>
    <Detail>178.6 Grams</Detail>
    </item>
    <item>... may be repeated ...</item>
</product>
```

# The Unified Listing Data structure

The raw GARI data must be transformed into the format described in the [Unified Listing API documentation](https://github.com/the-t-in-rtf/unified-listing/blob/master/front-end/api/docs/ul.md).

# Converting from GARI to the Unified Listing format

## Core mapping
The following table describes how the existing XML maps to the core JSON structure of a Unified Listing record.  XML elements are referenced using XPATH notation relative to the `product` element.  JSON elements are referenced using dot notation relative to a JSON object called product.  Static values are enclosed in quotation marks.

| UL data | GARI data |
| ------- | --------- |
| `product.source`  | "gari" |
| `product.sid` | `product/objectId` |
| `product.name` | `product/model` |
| `product.description` | "" |
| `product.manufacturer.name` | `product/productbrand` |
| `product.manufacturer.url` | `product/website` |
| `product.manufacturer.country` | `product/countries` |
| `product.language` | "en_us" |
| `product.updated` | `product/datecompleted` |
| `product.ontologies.context.id` | `product/platform` |
| `product.ontologies.context.version` | `product/platformversion` |

Please note, the value of the GARI `datecompleted` element is converted to [the ISO standard date format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) before it is stored.

Note also that GARI does not provide any kind of description in their dataset.  This field is ordinarily not allowed to be empty.  As a final note, all of their data is only available in English.

## Ontologies data

All features (`item` elements) in the original data are converted to JSON and stored in the record's `ontologies` field under a `gari` entry.

GARI records also include information about the operating system available on the device.  This information is referred to as a `context` in the [Solutions Registry](http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Solution_Registry), and we extract the OS information for that purpose.

The combined data for the above example would look something like:

```
{
  ...
  ontologies: {
    gari: {
      features: {
        "Handset weight": {
          description: "Weight including battery.",
          detail: "178.6 Grams"
        }
      }
    },
    contexts: {
      "OS": [
        {
          "id": "android",
          "version": "KiKat 4.4"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

## Original Data

The original record format is converted to JSON data without any other changes and stored in the `sourceData` field.

## Sample Record

A final JSON representation of the sample record above should result in JSON data like:

```
{
  source: "gari",
  sid: "1808",
  name: "SGH-I317 (Galaxy Note2)",
  description: "",
  manufacturer: {
    name:    "Samsung",
    url:     "http:www.samsung.com/us",
    country: "United States"
  },
  ontologies: {
    gari: {
      features: {
        "Handset weight": {
          description: "Weight including battery.",
          detail: "178.6 Grams"
        }
      }
    },
    contexts: {
      "OS": [
        {
          "id": "android",
          "version": "KiKat 4.4"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  sourceRecord: {
   // omitted for brevity
  },
  updated: "2014-10-30"
}
```
